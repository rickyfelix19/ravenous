## About <a name = "about"></a>

Welcome to the Ravenous project, where you’ll be building a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, you’ll be creating an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Through the four parts of Ravenous, you’ll build upon this foundation, adding features such as sorting and filtering options, and dynamic search results. By the end of the project, you’ll have developed a fully functional restaurant recommendation website that will help users find their next favorite eatery.
